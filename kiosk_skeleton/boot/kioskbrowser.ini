[vnc]
; VNC is pretty insecure, so it's always bound to localhost. Use an SSH tunnel to connect via VNC.

; autossh can be used to keep a connection to a specified SSH server up-and-running to allow for remote access 
; without the need for port forwarding, public IPv4 addressing, dynamic DNS, etc.

; security warning: ensure sshd_config "GatewayPorts" is set to "clientspecified" or "no".
; GatewayPorts=yes will cause the kioskpi to be globally bound (0.0.0.0, regardless of the bind-address specified above) and be reachable from the internet!
; This might be a huge risk.
