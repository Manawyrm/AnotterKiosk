; ADVANCED SETTINGS FOR LOW-END HARDWARE
; ==========================================
; Use hardware accelleration (GPU / OpenGL) to render Chromium
; Enabling HW accel on old Raspberry Pi's can lead to bad performance
; Recommended for modern devices and x86 PCs with well-supported GPUs
hardware_accel=1
; Chromium's built-in low-end-device-mode will limit color depth of images to 16bit (65536 colors)
; This flag will also disable composited-antialiasing.
; Might be useful on 512MiB devices like Pi 1, Zero W, etc.
low_end_device_mode=0
; Disable any local caching entirely. 
; Will save memory, cause slower loading times and more network traffic.
disable_cache=0

[audio]
; Select a specific audio output device (for example HDMI, 3.5mm headphone jack, USB audio, etc.)
; Run "aplay -L" via SSH to figure out the device name, if unknown.
; 
; Raspberry Pi HDMI output:
;device = "plughw:CARD=vc4hdmi,DEV=0"
; Raspberry Pi 3.5mm headphone output:
;device = "plughw:CARD=Headphones,DEV=0"

[watchdog]
; The watchdog can be used to ensure that a website is always being displayed (and JS is running).
; Javascript needs to send regular XHR/AJAX/etc. requests to http://localhost/heartbeat.php
enabled=0
; Seconds until the browser is restarted (to fix problems like error pages being displayed, temporary connection problems)
timeout=60
; Seconds until the whole computer is restarted (to fix worse issues like crashed firmware, lost time sync, broken certificates, etc.)
timeout_reboot=600

[vnc]
; VNC is pretty insecure, so it's always bound to localhost. Use an SSH tunnel to connect via VNC.
enabled=0

[autossh]
; autossh can be used to keep a connection to a specified SSH server up-and-running to allow for remote access 
; without the need for port forwarding, public IPv4 addressing, dynamic DNS, etc.
enabled=0
args = "-p 22 -R 1234:127.0.0.1:22 tunnel@example.com"
; security warning: ensure sshd_config "GatewayPorts" is set to "clientspecified" or "no".
; GatewayPorts=yes will cause the kioskpi to be globally bound (0.0.0.0, regardless of the bind-address specified above) and be reachable from the internet!
; This might be a huge risk.
