Welcome to AnotterKiosk!

This system is read-only, so you cannot modify the filesystem in any way.

Run "mount -o remount,rw /" to make the root filesystem writeable.
Run "mount -o remount,rw /boot/firmware" to make the config filesystem writeable.

The config file is located at /boot/firmware/kioskbrowser.ini
System logs can be viewed using "journalctl -ef" and "dmesg"
